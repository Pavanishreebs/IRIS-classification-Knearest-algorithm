# IRIS-classification-Knearest-algorithm
This project focuses on classifying the Iris dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species:  Setosa Versicolor Virginica Using KNN, we classify an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.
**The project involves the following steps:**
*Data collection and preparation
*Data exploration and visualization
*Training and testing data division
*Feature scaling
*Model building using KNN algorithm
*Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

This project is implemented using Python and popular libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The code and instructions are provided in the Jupyter notebook.
